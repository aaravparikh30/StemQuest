        <p class="opportunity-description">The Multi-scale Electrochemical Engineering (ME2) lab is hiring 2-3 undergraduate researcher positions for the summer of 2023. The students will work 10-20 hours a week with an hourly pay of $10-15 for a duration of 8-16 weeks. The undergrad students will assist PhD students to perform experiments, including designing and manufacturing electrochemical reactors, fabrication and testing of batteries, data process and analysis. The ME2 lab is conducting cutting-edge research on energy and sustainability, with applications in batteries, energy storage, critical material extraction, industry decarbonization, plastic upcycling, etc. The experiences will help students to secure job opportunities in the battery manufacturing, electric vehicles, renewable energy, mining, chemical etc. industries.</p>

      <p class="opportunity-description">Opportunity to work on a proof-of-principle bicycle helmet with autonomously closing vents (suitable for engineers, material scientists, chemists).

        Smart hydrogels are materials that able to change their volume depending on environmental parameters like, e.g., temperature and light. Especially temperature and light sensitivity of our specifically designed hydrogels can be exploited to let them perform autonomous sensing and actuating tasks. We plan to use this function for the autonomous closing and opening of vents, e.g., in bicycle helmets or tent screens. The mesh will be coated with smart hydrogels we develop in our lab. In the dry state the hydrogel has its smallest volume and, as a result, the vents are open. In wet conditions, i.e. rain, the hydrogel fibers swell and the vents are autonomously being closed within minutes. When the rain stops, the vents will open again thanks to the mesh's environmental responsivity.</p>

      <h3 class="opportunity-title"><center>Werner Lab</center></h3>
      <p class="opportunity-description">Our 'work-horse' model organism is the nematode Pristionchus pacificus, which develops one of two possible mouth forms in adults, depending on conditions experienced as juveniles: a narrow stenostomatous morph with one denticle, or a wide eurystomatous morph with two "teeth". Stenostomatous morphs are obligate bacteriavores, while the eurystomatous morph can predate on other nematodes. In nature the developmental decision is effected by adult pheromones (Bose et al., 2012, Werner et al. 2018), while in the lab we can utilize simple culture conditions to modulate mouth form preference.</p>

Yet, people find it difficult to manage security and privacy when interacting with technology, creating potential risks for their online safety and well-being. To address this issue, this research will focus on understanding people’s preferences and practices pertaining to cybersecurity-related matters and designing user experiences (UX) that help users manage their security and privacy in a more informed way.</p>

      <p class="opportunity-description">Twisted coiled polymer actuators (TCPAs) are an emergent type of thermomotive artificial muscle that have recently biome-chanically surpassed human skeletal muscles (HSM). Post annealing, an increase in temperature causes a twisted elastomeric fiber to untwist, but when coiled it dissipates the torsional energy through up-coiling to obey the law of topological invariance. This all results in tensile contraction (TC) and Tensile Stress (TS). We are trying to optimize the polymer material properties to improve action.</p>

      <p class="opportunity-description">Our lab studies fundamental functions of photobodies in plants. Photobodies are photoreceptor-containing biomolecular condensates that sense light and function as eyes of plants. Their phase separation behaviors in the nucleus send anterograde signals to organelles such as chloroplast to control greening life of plants. We aim to identify molecular and cellular mechanisms by which photobodies control biogenesis of chloroplasts using molecular biology, cell biology, and genetic approaches. </p>
